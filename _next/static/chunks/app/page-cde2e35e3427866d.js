Cybersecurity has become a major focus for everyone because of AI. Attackers can now create similar-looking pages in minutes, host them in a shady service and harm users instantly. Traditional approach of web extensions like uBlockOrigin fail to catch up because: 1. Someone has to add the URL to blocklist manually. 2. Users have to update their blocklist periodically. 3. Only works with URL and not with the contents of page. The 1st and 2nd point make it difficult for users to get realtime updates. The 3rd point is unfeasible by traditional extensions because the attacker can always change the page's content depending upon the visitor. This makes it impossible for security experts to catch the issue. For example, the attacker can target poor under-developed countries by showing the malicious page only for IPs originating from that country and show placeholder pages for others. Considering all these, we can conclude that we need two things: 1. An improved way to detect malicious content directly from the page. 2.

How UncomplexDoc Improves the Market Experience 1. Local-First AI Processing Problem: Most document analysis tools send sensitive data to cloud servers, raising privacy concerns Our Solution: All AI processing happens locally on your device using QVAC, ensuring complete data privacy 2. Unified Document Intelligence Problem: Users need multiple tools for different document types (contracts, invoices, reports) Our Solution: One interface handles all document types with context-aware AI analysis 3. Real-Time Risk Assessment Problem: Traditional tools provide generic analysis without understanding business context Our Solution: Dynamic risk scoring that adapts to your specific document type and business needs 4. Conversational Document Interaction Problem: Static PDF readers and basic search functions make it hard to extract insights Our Solution: Chat with your documents naturally - ask questions, get summaries, find specific clauses 5. No Cloud Dependencies Problem: Cloud-based tools require internet, have latency, and create vendor lock-in Our Solution: Works offline, instant processing, and you own your data and models 6. Cost-Effective Enterprise Solution Problem: Enterprise document AI tools charge per API call or per page Our Solution: One-time model download, unlimited processing at zero marginal cost 7. Knowledge Base Integration (MiniRAG). Problem: Each document is analyzed in isolation, missing organizational context. Our Solution: Builds a local knowledge base that enhances future document analysis. Key Differentiators: Privacy by Design: Zero data leaves your device. Speed: No network latency, instant results. Flexibility: Swap AI models based on your needs. Transparency: See exactly how the AI interprets your documents. Accessibility: Beautiful, intuitive interface that anyone can use.

QMesh transforms idle computing power into valuable infrastructure. Right now, millions of devices sit unused for hours daily - your laptop while in meetings, your desktop overnight, your gaming PC between sessions. This represents massive wasted computational capacity that could be processing AI workloads.\n\nTraditional AI platforms like OpenAI or Anthropic maintain expensive data centers running 24/7, passing infrastructure costs to users through high subscription fees. Meanwhile, users' own devices with capable CPUs and GPUs sit idle most of the day. QMesh bridges this inefficiency by turning idle compute time into productive LLM inference capacity.\n\nWhen your device is idle, it can process inference requests for others and earn credits. When you need AI assistance, those credits give you priority access to the network. This creates a self-sustaining economy where wasted compute becomes valuable currency. Instead of paying $20/month for ChatGPT while your $2000 laptop sits unused 80% of the time, you contribute idle cycles and get AI services in return.\n\nThe market impact is significant - platforms could eliminate multi-million dollar cloud bills by leveraging their users' collective compute power. Users get cheaper or free AI services while monetizing hardware they already own. It's like Airbnb for computing - turning unused capacity into value. This fundamentally changes the economics of AI services from centralized cost centers to distributed value creation, making AI more accessible while reducing the environmental impact of redundant data centers.",githubUrl:"https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-hackathon-hk250919/pull/34",demoUrl:void 0,videoUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DD1aL_D56YX6NYd_kwsZ6snxRAyDDusP/view",category:"Software",pearLink:"pear run pear://4amnw4kw5pwnwqsk6wrj343f1dfs1o71u6qdja3xytxiisx3ofjo"},{id:"project-33",name:"Fluxion (AI System Health Analyzer)",organization:"Pointsville",participants:["sarvesh@pointsville.com","aditya@pointsville.com"],thumbnail:"/thumbnails/project-33.png",description:"Local AI system health monitor providing real‑time insights and recommendations without sending data to the cloud.",longDescription:"Runs entirely on-device with a lightweight local AI (QVAC SDK), delivering real-time analysis and recommendations without sending data to the cloud—better privacy, lower latency, and offline reliability.\nThis is a Cross‑platform Electron app with a modern React UI that surfaces actionable insights (not just charts), speeding up troubleshooting compared to traditional dashboard-only monitoring tools.",githubUrl:void 0,demoUrl:void 0,videoUrl:void 0,category:"Software",pearLink:void 0},{id:"project-34",name:"Total Recall (QVAC Notes)",organization:"Noxtton",participants:["c.mindiashvili@noxtton.com","g.tskhvediani@noxtton.com","n.dolidze@noxtton.com","n.razmadze@noxtton.com","t.kapanadze@noxtton.com"],thumbnail:"/thumbnails/project-34.png",description:"Your memory, across devices — or just on this one.
